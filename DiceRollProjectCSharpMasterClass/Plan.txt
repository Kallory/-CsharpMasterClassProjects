usecases
----------------
The system shall generate a dice roll 1-6 behind the scenes
The system shall prompt the user for a guess
The system shall accept an input from the user for a guess
The system shall validate the input
The system shall compare the user input with the generated dice roll
The system shall display feedback to the user

Entities
-----------
Dice          only talks with guess controller
User          only talks with guess controller
Guesses       only talks with guess controller

Boundaries
------------
Guesser        actor only talks with this class

Controllers
------------
Guess Controller      Guesser class talks to this controller, vice versa, talks with entity classes
			does not talk with actors



Actors can only talk to boundary objects.
Boundary objects can only talk to controllers and actors.
Entity objects can only talk to controllers.
Controllers can communicate with boundary objects, entity objects, and other controllers, but not directly with actors.

Users talk to guesser class which talks to guess controller which then talks to entity classes


- The system shall generate a dice roll 1-6 behind the scenes - RollDice() shall belong to Dice class, gets called by Guess Controller. NumGuesses Shall be a property of the User, to practice scaleability and allow many users. 
- The system shall prompt the user for a guess - PromptForGuess() shall belong to Guesses Class, gets called by Guess Controller
- The system shall accept an input from the user for a guess - same as above
- The system shall validate the input - Internal private method ValidateGuess() inside Guesses class
- The system shall compare the user input with the generated dice roll - CompareGuess() inside Guesses class, called by Guess Controller
- The system shall display feedback to the user - Part of the Guesses Class, called by Guess Controller.

bare bones start to finish plan
- Implement RollDice() and display it to verify it works in Dice class (will rename to Roll so can call, Dice.Roll();
- Implement PromptForGuess() with the answer being shown first, for testing purposes, in the Guesses Class, don't validate or compare yet
- Implement Guesser boundary class to talk to controller. So main method will create an instance of Guesser and then we'll have stub/debugging info to verify everything works up to this point and have a bare bones start to finish program.
